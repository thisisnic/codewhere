Description: Find the location of the code for an R package based on the package's name or string representation.  
  Checks on 'CRAN' based on information in the 'URL' field or 'BioConductor' and 'GitHub' based on constructing 
  a URL, and verifies all paths via testing for a successful response. This can be useful when automating static 
  code analysis based on a list of package names, and similar tasks.
